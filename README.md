# rtc-git-connector
Connect RTC work items with various Git hosting systems

This is a remake of the git-commit-picker by the jazz-community.
The goal is to offer the same functionality as the current version but built in a much more extendable way.
Consequently it will be much easier to add support for multiple git hosts as well as for creating links to issues and merge / pull requests.

This is being implemented to save time and nerves. Extend the existing plugin is not easy to say the least.
